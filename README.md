# advent-of-code-2020

I was late to the party for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).  But,
as it turns out, Advent of Code is fantastic for learning a new programming
language, tools, styles, and so on, due to the low floor (just get the right
answer) and high self-imposed ceiling (how can I make my working solution
better?).

Advent of Code happens to be in the "Goldilocks zone" of interesting enough to
be fun, but not so hard as to be discouraging (at least for the early
problems). It is way, way less intimidating than tackling a fully-fledged
project in a new language.

For the 2020 problems, I'm using it to learn
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/index), alongisde my daily staple, Python.

I have no hard intentions to finish *every* problem, nor to work on a problem
every day. This is just a little bit of fun to see how far I can get!
